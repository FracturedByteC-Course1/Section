1 In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
2 From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
3 Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
4 From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
5 A pair of star-cross’d lovers take their life;
6 Whose misadventured piteous overthrows
7 Do with their death bury their parents’ strife.
8 The fearful passage of their death-mark’d love,
9 And the continuance of their parents’ rage,
10 Which, but their children’s end, nought could remove,
11 Is now the two hours’ traffic of our stage;
12 The which if you with patient ears attend,
13 What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.
